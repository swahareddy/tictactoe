The program is the C code for the game Tic-Tac-Toe (X and O).
The code has two modes: Single player and Multi-player.

The single player mode uses basic Artificial Intelligence algorithms to intelligently predict the next move.
The multiplayer mode lets two players play against each other with different sets of keyboard inputs while displaying their latest move side by side.
    
The program uses basic features of stdio.h and of ncurses.h (Graphics Library).
